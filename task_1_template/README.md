This is the repository for Task 1:  The template structure for silicon structural color inverse design. 

# File introduction:

`./Color`: Necessary files for converting the reflection spectrum to color. 

`./data`: Dataset used for training.

`./data_predicted`: The 1000 predicted structure for Green color inverse design. Used for analyze diversity. 

`./models`: Saved 3 models (tandem, VAE, GAN).

`check_color.ipynb`: Examine the diversity of each model. 

`check_results_final.ipynb`: Examine the traininig process and color accuracy.
