# benchmark_in_de

Source code for the paper 'Benchmarking Deep Learning-based Models on Nanophotonic Inverse Design Problems'.

## Two inverse design tasks:

### Color inverse design based on template structures.


### Transmission spectrum inverse design based on the free-from structures. 





## How to load files



### 
Due to the file size limitation in Github, please download the training data, several trained models, and the predicted results here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXDLD6ydglWOBs8TvXCm3-S5YbgiWuU4?usp=sharing. After download, add those folders under './task_2_free_form/....'.



(we are still construct this dataset and code base).
