# Benchmarking Deep Learning-based Models on Nanophotonic Inverse Design Problems

This repository is the implementation of paper [Benchmarking deep learning-based models on nanophotonic inverse design problems](https://www.oejournal.org/article/doi/10.29026/oes.2022.210012)

# Introduction
## 1. Two inverse design tasks:

### Color inverse design based on template structures.

### Transmission spectrum inverse design based on the free-from structures. 

## 2. 



## How to load files



### 
Due to the file size limitation in Github, please download the training data, several trained models, and the predicted results here: . After download, add those folders under './task_2_free_form/....'.



(we are still construct this dataset and code base).
