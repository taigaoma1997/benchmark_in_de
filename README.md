Source code for the paper 'Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on Nanophotonic Inverse Design'.

## Two inverse design tasks:

### Color inverse design based on template structures.

### Transmission spectrum inverse design based on the free-from structures. 


(we are still construct this dataset and code base).
